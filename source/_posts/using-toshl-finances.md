It has been four years since I started using Toshl for managing my personal finances. What I liked the most about it is it's simplicity. While simple, it still lets you categorize your finances as complicated as you want. The most informative way I use Toshl is to track how much I spent or saved during a given period and on what categories did I spend the most. The reason they always supported a wide variety of platform also pleased me, especially since I'm a user of much smaller Windows Phone platform. But even if you use a platform they don't support, there's always their recently updated web application [toshl.com](http://toshl.com).

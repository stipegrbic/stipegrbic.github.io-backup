I have to admit that until recently I couldn't tell when was the last time I read a complete book. Especially a book that I didn't have to read to learn or to get a grade. A month ago I read a book.

### How I started
There was a book fair in Zagreb which I attended and got two books, actually titles that got my attention. I wasn't sure when or will I ever read them but I felt I had a will. I thought the cold and dark days of winter are a perfect time to try to read. The first book I started was a thriller [Cell 8](https://www.amazon.com/Cell-8-Anders-Roslund/dp/162365128X). I knew I was a slow reader, and that was one of the reasons I didn't read more, but from the first day reading this book I noticed I'm reading faster and easier than before.

### How it went
I continued to read every evening, and it was surprising for me to experience not wanting to stop it. After about ten days I finished reading and realized that contrary to my beliefs I could read. There are a few things I blame for not reading before, school making you to read boring books, me not realizing there are interesting reads, and thinking that it's just something I don't like to do. Now I'm not saying that after reading a single book I'm a book worm, but this opened a world of reading to me. Now I'm curious of what other kind of books I like and am just about to start to read another one.

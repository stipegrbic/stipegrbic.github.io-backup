Hi, I'm Stipe GrbiÄ‡. I work as an independent software development, currently with a full time engagement.

My main domain of expertise is Windows desktop software development. You can see my experience and education information on my LinkedIn profile, but here's a brief history of my career.

As I finished the computer science master's degree and was eager to take a role in the real world sofware development, I started with Java web development. After a year or two, my old love for C# has risen through the appearance of Windows Phone OS. After a few applications done in my spare time, I decided to take a Windows desktop project on my day job as well. Now with Windows Phone being dead, so is my hobby Windows Phone app development. But for this reason I may have more time for actual side projects, so if you need help with software development, don't hesitate to contact me.

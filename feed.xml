It’s a port of my Windows app which is much more functional, but it’s still only a Windows app and I wanted my web version to be as functional as a Windows app. This time I tried to add email reminders about events. So, the Windows app has a functionality that it can notify you about your events with a schedu... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Side projects (sometimes) pay off</title><link href="https://stipegrbic.github.io/posts/side-projects-pay-off/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Side projects (sometimes) pay off" /><published>2022-02-22T11:11:39+01:00</published> <updated>2022-02-22T11:11:39+01:00</updated> <id>https://stipegrbic.github.io/posts/side-projects-pay-off/</id> <content src="https://stipegrbic.github.io/posts/side-projects-pay-off/" /> <author> <name>Stipe Grbić</name> </author> <category term="software development" /> <category term="node.js" /> <summary> Having a side project every now and then is beneficial in many ways. Recently I had such positive experience from some of my side projects that are more than five years old. My manager asked me “Hey do you have some node.js experience?” and it was such a good feeling to answer “yes”. As a reader of my blog, you may have noticed I’m primarily a .NET developer, but during my career and in my sp... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>My first iOS development experience</title><link href="https://stipegrbic.github.io/posts/my-first-ios-development-experience/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="My first iOS development experience" /><published>2021-01-28T11:34:43+01:00</published> <updated>2021-01-28T11:34:43+01:00</updated> <id>https://stipegrbic.github.io/posts/my-first-ios-development-experience/</id> <content src="https://stipegrbic.github.io/posts/my-first-ios-development-experience/" /> <author> <name>Stipe Grbić</name> </author> <category term="software development" /> <category term="xamarin" /> <summary> Due to some circumstances, I came in a possession of a Mac mini. This meant only one thing - I had to create an iOS app. My way of thinking was, let’s go completely native - Swift can’t be that hard to learn. Create WatchOS app - I miss a lot of functionality on the Apple Watch. After some attempts and giving up I turned to the good old C# and Xamarin.Forms. iOS native development Yes, my id... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>My first ASP.NET Core MVC app</title><link href="https://stipegrbic.github.io/posts/my-first-asp-net-core-mvc-app/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="My first ASP.NET Core MVC app" /><published>2020-07-09T00:23:50+02:00</published> <updated>2020-07-09T00:23:50+02:00</updated> <id>https://stipegrbic.github.io/posts/my-first-asp-net-core-mvc-app/</id> <content src="https://stipegrbic.github.io/posts/my-first-asp-net-core-mvc-app/" /> <author> <name>Stipe Grbić</name> </author> <category term="software development" /> <category term="web" /> <summary> As you might have noticed I created a Windows application to calculate time span between two dates Event Timing. Since I’m not always sitting by my Windows PC, I got the need to have this little calculator app available on the web. This evening the web app went from idea to production. The most important motivation for this application was to quickly calculate how old is my baby in days. For ... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Blocked?

Be it feature implementation, bug fix or some kind of software migration I couldn’t finish until someone else does their job first. What to do during this time? I learned that you can’t just say “I’m blocked and can’t do anything until I get unblocked” because there’s so much you can do to prepare for when you get unblocke... </summary> </entry> </feed>
